Here we are, another year is about to end. 2016 is around the corner, a lot of new opportunities will come with it. To me, I believe this year might be a crucial one to define my future. Theorically, I will have my certificate about programming in my pocket. Hope the internship will be complete, with success. After that, I will do everything to start my career as a front end developer while keeping my longer-term goal to start my own company.

The end of 2015 will be dedicated to prepare 2016 the best way possible. Books, courses, habits ... you name it. I'll make sure that I have all the cards I need to have a great year. I'll begin with buying a bunch of books to read. I still have to complete the list and settle on a reasonable number to buy. Then, I'll probably try to be a little more present on the freelancing world, trying to get a few jobs to get me going. Not for the money, but to get familiar with clients and some of their problems.

Habits...On top of my head: waking up early, yoga, meditating, reading, practice musical instrument. I don't put exercise int it, I pretty much have it down. I do have some trouble with keeping waking up early on a daily basis. I woke up at 8H30 this morning...and 6H yesterday. I do need more consistency in this regard. I also like to toy around with my harmonica and my ukulele, even though I should probably try to be better at it :) .

I'll also try to figure out what I can do to improve my skills as a front-end developper a bit more. Outside of trying to copy already existing website and follow courses on TreeHouse, there might be stuff I can do to keep getting better. I will try to look at gitHub a bit more and contribute, that's also a goal of mine: be more involved in the community.

Anyway, a lot of exiting stuff coming up !!!
