Knowledge is power they say. I think it's true. Knowing things makes me feel good. It makes me feel more valuable, when I'm learning something, I don't feel like I'm wasting my time. So I read books, a lot of them.

As a aspiring web developper, I read a lot of books treating about web design, software creation ... I feel a little sense of pride when I look at the number of books I have in my room, on my shelves. I'm not really sure why. I guess it means to me that i'm working towards my goals as I'm trying to become a better and more knowledgeable developper, reader, person...

I also really like books that touch on the self-improvement subject. How to change your habits, practice better, what talent really is. It fascinates me. I learn so much from those books. And I makes me realize that success is not reserved for the special people among us, It is available to everyone, as long as we are willing to work towards it with the right mindset and the proper methodology.

Then, there are the fictional books. Those are in French. I prefer to read that kind of books in my native language so I don't miss out clever sentences or some emotions that you can't always understand if you are not absolutely confortable with the other language. I always like the anticipation theme. books like 1984 from Orwell, Farenheit 451 from Bradbury or the Best of worlds from Huxley. I always find it interesting to see an author imagine what the future will look like, even if It looks really scary most of the time.

I will create a page dedicated to reviews of the books that I felt were important to my developpement. Maybe, It will help someone as much as It helped me.
