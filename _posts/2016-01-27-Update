January is almost gone already. I can't say that I've been keeping up with habits that I wanted to have. But I keep working on it. My classes are going well, my first exams will be next month. I'm feeling pretty confident about it.
My JAVA project about the roulette is done. I juste have to complete the analysis et send the whole thing. Not really happy about a few things but I don't think I can do a whole lot better with the skills that I have right now. Not really a difficult project, just a big while loop that contains some for loops and some if statements. Add a few functions on the side and you got yourself a roulette game.
One of my new year's resolutions was to start contributing on GitHub. I did it once, and all I did was replace some underscore with dashes. But hey, I understand you have to start somewhere and my skills don't allow me to do crazy stuff yet. I keep looking around for things to do, focusing on the projects that I use myself. But It really is not that easy.

I do believe my front-end skills have improve. My websites feel a lot more fluid. I discovered the beauty of the clearfix, what an amazing invention !!! 
I probably should work a bit more on my personal website, adding some stuff to my portfolio.
Yeah, I'll look into it...
