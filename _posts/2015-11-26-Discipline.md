Discipline is key to achieve anything. We are creatures of habits. We can create new habits and override old ones. It just takes discipline.

Right now, I'm trying to wake up early (5 AM). I have never really benn a morning person, so it's not that easy. Here are a few known tricks that I use, or try to use.

-Put your alarm clock (For me, my Ipad) far away from your bed. you have to get out of your comfy bed to turn it off

-Now the tricky part. Don't go back to bed!! You have to trigger a certain routine at that point to make sure you will not fall back asleep.

-Drink water, put your workout clothes, go for a walk, meditate... I'm still trying to find the perfect routine that will keep me awake and ready to roll.

-Track some of your habits. Either the good that you want to create or the bad that you want to override. You can't destry bad habits, just replace them with good ones. 

Each habit has a cue (a trigger) that tells your brain: Go to auto-pilot now! You follow the routine you had for months or years and BAM, you get a reward. Now, this allows your brain to not burnout. It doesn't have to manage to thousands of actions you take everyday and concentrate on the things that really matter. 

Your brain expects a reward. You 'just' have to make sure that your brain receives the same kind of reward but you change the routine. But you also have to identify what triggers (the cue) the routine. 

Are you snacking because you're bored? Find someone to talk to.
Because you're hungry? Choose a fruit over an unhealty snack.
Do you just need to move? Go for a walk...

Etc...
If you are interested in habits, how to form them, how to override them. I highly recommend you The power of habits from Charles Duhigg. It's a very informative and well-written book about those matters.
It really changed the way I was looking at a lot of my habits who I thought were unbreakable and et habits I wanted to create but thought It was impossible.

But it all comes down to...
Discipline.
