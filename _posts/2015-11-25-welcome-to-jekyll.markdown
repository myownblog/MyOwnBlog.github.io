This is my first entry to my new blog. Welcome !

I'm creating this blog for a lot of reasons. 

-The first one being that I wanted to learn more about jekyll. So I created this little thing that you are currently reading to familiarize myself with it.

-The second reason is my love for writing. I always loved to write stuff, on paper or with a keyboard. Having a blog like this one help me expressing my ideas to myself and to the world. 

-The third reason is my strong belief that writing stuff down makes a lot of things easier. May it be a dream, a problem, a solution, It alaways seems more clear to me when I can go back and relate to it.

So, I embarked on this journey to become a better developper, a better football player, better musician and a better person. This blog is not really meant to be read by hundreds of thousands of people, but it will help me in a lot of ways. 

You're free to join me anyway you want.

Damien.
